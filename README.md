Enhancing Security Operations: SIEM Qradar & SOC Dashboard Management "SIEM Implementation: The project will deploy and configure the IBM Qradar SIEM solution, integrating it with the organization's existing network infrastructure, security devices, and data sources. This will enable centralized log collection, real-time event correlation, threat detection, and incident response capabilities.Dashboard Customization: The SOC dashboard will be designed and tailored to provide a comprehensive and intuitive view of the organization's security posture. 
The project will collaborate with SOC analysts to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), relevant metrics, and visualizations that will empower analysts to effectively monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents. Threat Intelligence Integration: The SIEM system will be integrated with external threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability databases to enrich the analysis and detection capabilities. This integration will provide real-time information on emerging threats, known attack vectors, and potential vulnerabilities, empowering the SOC team to proactively respond to emerging risks.
